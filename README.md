jobfair
=======

This is a side project for Medallia that allows taking a very simple (and currently, hardcoded) survey during a Job Fair.
For this project to work it is necessary to update the Parse keys on MMAppDelegate.m file, so the app can connect to Parse to read and write the results to it.
This app is only meant to be executed on iPad with iOS 6.1 or above.

Future work:
- Make the questions dynamic
- Add more types of questions
- Improve the statistics page
- Maybe add some physics to it so make the experience more engaging.
